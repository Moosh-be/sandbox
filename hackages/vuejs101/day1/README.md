## The way vue works

Vue is essentially doing a: **whenDataChanges** => doStuff

You don't have a good way to divide the work until you have a framework that allows you to split the work in small component.

You need a clear interface between the components to split the work and share the work. As long as the public API (Interface) stay consistant.

### Bindings

#### Mustache templating system

    {{ }} // is the mustache template system

inside there is a javascript expression => expression are evaluated to get a value. It is not a statement.

**Those are expression**

    {{ message }}

    {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}

**This is not an expression**

    {{ if (foo) {} }}

So how to do conditional?

    {{ ok ? 'true':'false' }}

### v-*

Any attrivute that start with **v-** is a javscript expression

#### v-html

**v-html** is dangerous, use it only on things you can trust

    <div v-html="someHTML + 'foo'"></div>

### Security rules

Don't ever use component that you can't control/trust
